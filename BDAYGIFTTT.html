        So uh I've been trying to knit for a minute now. All I have is the skinniest scarf in the world (BUT I AIN'T DONE YET). I'm going to keep working on it and give it to you eventually, but something that WILL be presentable by your birthday is THIS. I know you don't celebrate your birthday and I'm lowkey bad at celebrating birthdays so I'm just going to chat abt how much I love you and "spam" my favorite images and moments of us.

    <h4>
        SO OF COURSE WE GOT MY FAV IMAGE OF YOUUU
    </h4>
    <p>
        Haven't really decided or not, but what I wanna do it keep this website and just make it bigger and bigger for every birthday. I feel like that would be kind of cool ngl.

            She's so cute and I still can't believe I haven't seen her in real life yet. Pretty sure she'd bite my hand off but I'd love to play with her for a bit. Belly rubs for sure.

            Hopefully this final letter will be easy on your eyes. If it isn't, please try and read it to the best of your ability. I'll read it out loud to you if you want, okay baby?

            So I don't wanna keep this toooo long bc ion wanna bore you plus we have more birthdays to come that'll keep this thing expanding anyway, but I realized that most if not all of our moments aren't acc on video or pictures for obvious reasons so I'm going to write a loooong paragraph or so js about them. To start, I no longer remember why I call her LandOtter. I'm always gonna call her that and continue to call her then but I lowkey forgot the reason. Please, remind me asap. Yknow every now and then I remember how shocked I was that you went for tongue immediately on our first kiss and I just find that so funny. Very glad you taught me eventually (AFTER I BEGGED FOR SO LONG). I could go on for a while about those hangouts but I'd rather say it in person so if you're not too busy wanna call after school on the 18th. If you really can't I'll probably just put in a voice note but yea I really want to call. <br> I am not spell-checking any of this shi (I am). I know after I fucked up and got you caught with the hickey you've lowkey been on lockdown but I'd also really like to go out somewhere again. At this point, Life360 aint even a problem anymore i could probably convince them to let me like anywhere non-alcoholic. Yknow how funny it would be if I put this as a secret comment and you don't find out about it till like 3 years later. You riding on the bus was def something I took for granted, genuinely just waking up isn't even the same. We don't even wake up at the same time anymore so we don't talk as much, plus you can't really call, plus we only see each other at lunch so it's idek. I'm not tryna be sad rn but I just really wish we could do that again. I especially remember that one day when you just had so much energy in the morning. It felt weird being the non-energetic one but it was nice to see you so lively. Def made my day. Then again you always make my day, especially with those good nights and good mornings. ICL this is probably gonna be my final edit as it's 11:50 pm on October 17, 2024, and I need to start spellchecking and looking over my code as a final, closing statement. I love you so much. You're amazing in so many ways I can hardly describe and you make me so happy every day. I can only hope I do the same for you but regardless I love you so much, baby. Everything you've ever done has either made me proud and happy or made me fall more and more in love with you. Happy 17th Birthday.
